### Day 1: June 22, 2018 

**Today's Focus**: Begin learning Python for Data Science.

**Details**:

 - Practice some basic concept of Python programming language. Read about Operators, Variables and Data types,
 functions, Data Structures etc.
 - Read about standard Libraries like Pandas. Learn working with Data frames and indexing of a Data frame.
 - Got an estimation of how we deal with data using Python.

### Day 2: June 23, 2018 

**Today's Focus**: Begin learning Statistics for Data Science.

**Details**:

 - Started learning from the very basic terms in Statistics like: Mean, Median and Mode. Learn type of variable i.e. continuous and categorical variables.
 - Lean the concept of [Outliers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlier) and how they affect the dataset. Got familiar with the terms like [Quantile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantile), [Quartile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartile).
 - Then I started learning Spread of Data. I learned about Range, [IQR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interquartile_range), [Variance of Data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance), [Standard Deviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation), [Frequency Table](http://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/descriptive-statistics/frequency-distribution-table/) and [Histograms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram).
